# Privacy Policy â€” DigitalMeve

_Last updated: 2025-09-05_

DigitalMeve does not store your documents. We only process files in-memory to compute a cryptographic hash and generate a proof.

## What we collect
- **Technical logs**: timestamp, operation type (generate/verify), file size (bytes), duration (ms), status (success/error).
- **No document contents**: we never persist file contents or previews server-side.
- **No personal tracking**: no advertising identifiers.

## Purpose of processing
- Operate the service (rate limiting, abuse prevention).
- Improve reliability and performance (aggregated metrics).

## Retention
- Technical logs: up to **30 days** (rolling), then deleted or aggregated.

## Data sharing
- No sale of data. Logs may be processed by cloud providers strictly for hosting/observability.

## Security
- Transport encryption (HTTPS).
- Principle of least privilege for service credentials.
- Responsible disclosure: see `SECURITY.md`.

## Your Choices
- You can self-host the open-source project to keep all processing offline.
- For API users, you can disable logs on a dedicated paid plan (contact us).
