# 🗺 DigitalMeve Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the evolution of **DigitalMeve** from MVP to global adoption.  
It is updated regularly to reflect progress and priorities.

## 🔵 Phase 1 — MVP (1–2 months)

✅ Generator `.meve` (CLI + Python script)  
✅ Verifier `.meve` (drag & drop UI + CLI)  
✅ Core features: SHA-256 hash + UTC timestamp + basic issuer  
⏳ Documentation set (Specification, Security, Examples, Guides)  

**Goal:** deliver a minimal but functional `.MEVE/1` ecosystem.

- Add **Official issuer level** (DNS / institutional verification)  
- Export **certified PDF** with DigitalMeve footer  
- Launch **Public API** for 3rd-party SaaS integrations  
- First **production pilots** with professionals and SMEs  

**Goal:** move from individuals → professional adoption.

## 🟠 Phase 3 — 1–2 years

- International **standardization** (ISO / AFNOR)  
- Integration into **ERP / CRM / university systems**  
- Large-scale adoption in **legal / governmental contexts**  
- Mobile & desktop apps (**open-source verifier**)
