# üõ° DigitalMeve Verification Guide

## Overview
DigitalMeve provides a fast and universal way to verify the authenticity of any `.meve` proof.  
Verification ensures:
1. The document has not been tampered with (hash validation).  
2. The proof contains a valid timestamp (UTC).  
3. The issuer identity matches the expected level (Personal, Pro, Official).
