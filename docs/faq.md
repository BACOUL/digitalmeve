# ❓ FAQ — DigitalMeve

Frequently asked questions about the `.meve` format, the CLI, and verification.

---

## 📄 What is a `.meve.json` file?

A sidecar JSON that contains the proof of existence and integrity of a document:

- `issued_at`: UTC ISO-8601 timestamp (`Z`)
- `hash_sha256`: file fingerprint
- `issuer` + `status`: Personal / Pro / Official
- Minimal metadata (`filename`, `size`)

---

## 🗂 Does DigitalMeve store my documents?

No. Neither the CLI nor the MVP API store your files.
Only the hash and minimal metadata are processed in memory to generate the proof.

---

## ✅ How do I verify a proof?

- **CLI:**

```bash
digitalmeve verify path/to/file.meve.json

Web (beta, coming soon): drag & drop the proof into the Verify page.



---

📌 Is the original file required for verification?

Full integrity check: yes, the hash_sha256 is recalculated on the original file and compared to the proof.

Inspection only (metadata, issuer, date…): the sidecar .meve.json alone is enough.



---

🏷 Difference between Personal, Pro, and Official?

Personal → self-certification (existence only).

Pro → verified professional email (magic link).

Official → verified institution/domain via DNS TXT.


> The status is always calculated by the verifier; it is never self-declared.




---

🖊 Is this a legally qualified electronic signature?

No. .meve establishes existence & integrity proof, not a qualified signature (per eIDAS).
It’s complementary.


---

🔄 What happens if I modify the document after generation?

Verification will fail: the hash_sha256 will no longer match.


---

📝 Can I include custom metadata?

Yes: via CLI (--meta key=value) or API.
Metadata is optional and free-form, but avoid sensitive data.


---

🔮 Will the format evolve?

Yes. The MEVE/1 schema is versioned and public: schemas/meve-1.schema.json.
Future versions will remain as backward-compatible as possible.


---

🌍 Can I publish my proof publicly?

Yes.

(Phase 2) A transparency log will allow periodic publication of Merkle roots.

In the meantime, you can share the .meve.json.
