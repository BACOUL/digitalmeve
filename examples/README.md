## ðŸ›  Usage

### 1. Generate proofs for example files

Run:

```bash
./make_examples.sh

This will create .meve.json proofs in the proofs/ folder for each file inside files/.


---

2. Verify all generated proofs

Run:

./verify_examples.sh

This will check all .meve.json files inside proofs/ and show whether they are valid.
