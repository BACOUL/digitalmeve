🚀 Vision

DigitalMeve creates a new universal certification format: .meve (Memory Verified).
A lightweight and human-readable file proving in 2 seconds:

1. The existence of a document at a given date.


2. The integrity of the document (via SHA-256 hash).


3. The authenticity of the issuer (Personal / Pro / Official).




---

🔑 Certification Levels

Personal → Self-certification (existence proof only).

Pro → Email verified (identity linked to a real professional).

Official → DNS verified / institution (official certification).


⚡ Certification level is always computed automatically by the verifier.


---

🛡 Security

Tamper-proof: any change in the file invalidates the .meve.

Metadata embedding (JSON or sidecar).

Scalable: .meve.json sidecar for large files.

Fraud detection: instant hash mismatch detection.



---
